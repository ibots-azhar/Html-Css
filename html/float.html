<h2>Variable Valves Actuation (VVA)</h2>
<p>This is the first ever high-performance VVA system that provides torque for ease of use even at low RPM. There are two intake valve cams: one for low- to mid-range rpm and another for high rpm. They switch between each other at the 7,400 rpm mark to ensure good power and torque is present throughout the entire rev range.</p>
